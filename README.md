# aynrandom
Ayn Random Number Generator, because brogrammers arenâ€™t politicized enough.

## Usage

```
require './aynrandom'

AynRand.om # => a random float between 0 and 1
# and a useful quote from Rand is pushed to the console to remind you who is most important.

AynRand.om 10 # => an integer between 0 and 10 
# and a useful quote from Rand is pushed to the console to remind you who is most important.
```

The random generator does not, yet, only favor the rich and individualistic.
