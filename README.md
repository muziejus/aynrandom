# aynrandom
Ayn Random Number Generator, because brogrammers aren’t politicized enough.

## Usage

```
require './aynrandom'

AynRand.om # => a random float between 0 and 1
# and a useful quote from Rand is pushed to the console to remind you who is most important.

AynRand.om 10 # => an integer between 0 and 10 
# and a useful quote from Rand is pushed to the console to remind you who is most important.

# in irb:
2.2.3 :001 > require ‘./aynrand’
 => true
2.2.3 :002 > AynRand.om
Anyone who fights for the future, lives in it today.
=> 0.19776009953694984
2.2.3 :003 > AynRand.om 10
When you consider socialism, do not fool yourself about its nature. Remember that there is 
no such dichotomy as “human rights” versus “property rights.” No human rights can exist 
without property rights.
=> 4


```

The random generator does not, yet, only favor the rich and individualistic.
